# Deep-Learning-Based-Plant-Health-State-Classification-Using-Image-Data
 This repository contains the implementation of an Attention-Enhanced DS-ResNet architecture designed for assessing the health of tomato plants. The model leverages depthwise separable convolutions, channel-wise attention mechanisms, and grouped convolutions to accurately classify plant health status on a scale of 1 to 5. It achieves an overall accuracy of 80.2% using 5-fold cross-validation on a comprehensive dataset annotated for the tomato plant's lifespan.
