# Deep-Learning-Based-Plant-Health-State-Classification-Using-Image-Data
 Tomatoes are rich in nutrients like lycopene, Î²-carotene, and vitamin C. However, they often suffer from biological and environmental stressors, resulting in significant yield losses. Traditional manual plant health assessments are error-prone and inefficient for large-scale production. To address this need, we developed a comprehensive dataset covering the tomato plant's lifespan, annotated for health status on a scale of 1 to 5. Our study introduces an Attention-Enhanced DS-ResNet architecture with channel-wise attention and grouped convolution, refined with new training techniques. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 80.2% using 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrating its potential to enhance plant health assessment.
